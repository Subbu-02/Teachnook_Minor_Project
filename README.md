# Countdown Timer


## Project Overview:
This minor project is made with the intention of partial fulfillment of my Data Science internship at Teachnook. I have incorporated Python and its libraries that were taught to me in the internship.

This project is a countdown timer that counts down from a particular time given by the user to zero. I have incorporated the Start, Pause and Reset features to make it more user-friendly. I have user tkinter for the user interface.


The default interface –

We can then pause this timer anytime –
